# COVIDwastewater

This project explores the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19, as we could observe the confirmed cases and viral load in wastewater. To get an appropriate model, we consider adding a new compartment 'Recovered but shedding' due to characteristics of the COVID-19. We aim at optimizing parameters in the model and fit this model to real data.
